# Matplotlib-challenge
Homework5

This is my overall fifth, and first 'Matplotlib' assignment. In this challenge, I performed the following tasks:
- Before my analysis, I checked the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and removed any data associated with that mouse ID.
- Used the cleaned data for the tasks.
- Generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
- Generated identical bar plots using both: Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that showed the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of my task.
- Generated identical pie plots using both: Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that showed the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
- Calculated the 'final tumor volume' of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens i.e. Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin; Calculated the quartiles and the IQR, and quantitatively determined if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
- Using Matplotlib, generated a box and whisker plot of the 'final tumor volume' for all four treatment regimens and highlighted any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
- Selected a mouse that was treated with 'Capomulin' and generated a line plot of 'tumor volume' versus 'time point' for that mouse.
- Generated a scatter plot of 'mouse weight' versus 'average tumor volume' for the 'Capomulin' treatment regimen.
- Calculated the 'correlation coefficient' and the 'linear regression model' between 'mouse weight' and 'average tumor volume' for the 'Capomulin' treatment; Plotted the 'linear regression model' on top of the previous scatter plot.
- Properly labelled my plots.
- Printed the sources out in my Jupyter Notebook, that I referred to in order to complete this 'Matplotlib' challenge.

Three Observations or Influences:
1. From the 'bar charts', we can infer that most of the mice reacted to 'Capomulin' and 'Ramicane'.
2. From the 'bar charts', we can infer that the mice reacted least to 'Propriva'.
3. From the 'pie chart', we can deduce that almost same number of male and female mice reacted to the drug regimen.
